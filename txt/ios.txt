### PAGE TITLE
**Project Showcase - RepBook-DemoServer**

### HERO SECTION
**Title:** RepBook  
**Subtitle:** Full Stack iOS Fitness Tracking Application with RESTful API and AI-Powered User Interactions

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
**RepBook** is a comprehensive full stack iOS application, seamlessly integrating a demo backend server to facilitate personal fitness tracking and dynamic workout customization. Users benefit from a personalized dashboard that aggregates essential fitness metrics, facilitating workout planning and AI-enhanced interactions that harness user history for tailor-made recommendations. Apple's Keychain underpins the authentication mechanics, ensuring user credentials are securely encrypted and managed, consolidating the application's robust security posture.

### KEY FEATURES
- **Secure Authentication:** Leverages bcrypt alongside PostgreSQL for fortified, encrypted login and signup mechanisms, ensuring user credentials withstand dictionary and brute-force attacks.
- **RESTful API Integration:** Crucial in managing user data and tracking workouts, REST's stateless architecture enhances scalability and seamless client-server interactions.
- **AI-Driven Personalization:** The AI assistant provides bespoke fitness advice, dynamically integrating user data for actionable insights and progress monitoring.
- **Apple Keychain Integration:** Delivers cryptographic safety, securely handling authentication tokens on iOS for elevated data protection.

### METHODOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE
The backbone of **RepBook** is crafted through a well-architected RESTful API, ensuring distinct separation between client and server interactions, fostering multipurpose backend support and scalable efficiency.

**Security Framework:**  
- User authentication relies on bcrypt, using the Blowfish cipher for computationally rigorous password hashing, effectively hardening security within the PostgreSQL database:
  \[
  y = \text{bcrypt}(x, \text{salt})
  \]

**Microservices and Machine Learning:**  
- Personalized recommendations are achieved through machine learning-driven microservices, optimizing scalable deployment and ongoing refinement.

**Technological Stack:**  
- Developed with Node.js for a resilient backend architecture, PostgreSQL for adept data management, and Swift for responsive iOS application performance.

### BACKGROUND CODE EXAMPLES
The provided API endpoint below illustrates a practical application of data retrieval, emphasizing secure and efficient data management practices in your server architecture.

```javascript
// API Endpoint to Retrieve Member Metrics
app.get('/membersMetrics/:memberId', authenticate, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { memberId } = req.params;
        if (!memberId) {
            console.error('Member ID is required but not provided');
            return res.status(400).send('Member ID is required');
        }
        const query = `
            SELECT * FROM members_metrics
            WHERE member_id = $1;
        `;
        const values = [memberId];

        console.log(`Executing SQL query: ${query} with memberId: ${memberId}`);
        const result = await pool.query(query, values);

        console.log(`Metrics fetched successfully for memberId: ${memberId}`);
        res.json(result.rows);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(`Error during fetching metrics for memberId: ${memberId}, Error: ${err.message}`);
        res.status(500).send(err.message);
    }
});
```

By crafting this narrative, recruiters can clearly discern your role and contributions, highlighting your understanding and application of critical software engineering concepts.
