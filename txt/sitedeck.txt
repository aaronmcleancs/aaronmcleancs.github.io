### PROJECT GALLERY

**Code Snippet Highlight: Dynamic Content Analysis**

The following snippet demonstrates SiteDeck's use of Node.js and server-side JavaScript to fetch and analyze website content. The integration with OpenAI's API allows SiteDeck to generate precise feedback tailored to each website's unique configuration.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const OpenAI = require('openai');

const app = express();
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

app.get('/analyze', async (req, res) => {
    const siteUrl = req.query.url;

    try {
        const data = await fetch(siteUrl).then(res => res.text());
        const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
            model: 'text-davinci-002',
            prompt: `Analyze the content of the following URL: ${siteUrl}`,
            max_tokens: 150
        });

        res.json({ analysis: response.choices[0].text });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Analysis failed:', error);
        res.status(500).send('Error analyzing site');
    }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```
