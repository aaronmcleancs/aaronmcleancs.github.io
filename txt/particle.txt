=== DETAILED COLLISION PRINCIPLES ===

--= Collision Detection in Games =--

In gaming environments, collision detection unfolds in two crucial phases:
1. **Broad Phase:** Determine which shape pairs warrant collision testing.
2. **Narrow Phase:** Conduct detailed collision analysis for the pairs identified.

In ParticleBox, the broad phase employs a dynamic loose grid system of square cells, ensuring that each shape is allocated to the cell encompassing its center. Shapes then check for collisions with others within their own cell and adjacent cells, optimizing collision tests.

Future tutorials will delve deeper into these systems, while this discussion focuses on narrow phase execution.

--= Collision Response via Projection =--

Understanding collision dynamics extends beyond detection; it requires deliberate response handling. When two objects, `a` and `b`, overlap, immediate resolutions involve either destruction or repositioning. Yet, for realistic physical simulation, such resolutions are inadequate.

The projection method, as introduced by Jakobsen, offers a nuanced solution. By repositioning objects along the shortest vector which alleviates overlap, projection ensures minimal penetration displacement. Other methodologies—like penalty-force or impulse-based approaches—modify positions, velocities, or accelerations, striving for optimal static repositioning.

ParticleBox utilizes the projection technique for its blend of simplicity and empirical effectiveness, providing both boolean collision results and required projection vectors (directional and depth measures).

--= Bounce and Friction =--

Upon collision resolution through projection, ParticleBox acts on velocity adjustment to recreate bounce and friction phenomena. Implementing:
1. **Projection:** Objects are extricated from penetration.
2. **Velocity Componentization:** Splitting velocities into collision-parallel and -perpendicular parts supports nuanced physical interactions.
3. **Bounce & Friction Calculations:** Velocity adjustments for realism, maintaining a balance between physical accuracy and engaging interaction dynamics.

ParticleBox integrates these principles to deliver physically authentic simulations aimed at providing both visual satisfaction and technical accomplishment.
